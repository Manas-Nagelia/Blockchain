# Blockchain
This is a barebones blockchain I built using TypeScript!

Note that we're using a proof-of-work system here, rather than the preferred proof-of-stake.

I will not be working on this project anymore. This project was only meant for educational purposes for myself. But, I encourage any developer to expand on this starting point.

Possible Updates:

- Implement a proof-of-stake system rather than the current proof-of-work system
- Improve the security of the blockchain
- Implement a GUI interface where users can view the blockchain in a graph
- Clean up the code
- Add more features that modern blockchains provide

To install this, use `yarn install`
