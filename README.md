# Blockchain
This is a barebones blockchain I built using TypeScript!

This is written in pure TypeScript. This release only contains the backend logic, no front-end. Note that we're using a proof-of-work system here, rather than the preferred proof-of-stake.

I will not be working on this project anymore. This project was only meant for educational purposes for myself. But, I encourage any developer to expand on this starting point.

Possible Updates:

- Implement a proof-of-stake system
- Improve the security
- Implement a GUI
- Improve the overall logic

To install this, use `yarn install`
